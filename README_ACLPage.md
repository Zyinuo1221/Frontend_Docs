## Introduction

The `ACLPage` component is a sophisticated React component built to demonstrate and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) within applications, utilizing Material UI for styling and layout. This component is designed to display content conditionally based on user permissions managed via `AbilityContext`.

## Features

- **Dynamic Conditional Rendering:** Renders UI elements based on user permissions.
- **Material UI Components:** Leverages Material UI for modern, responsive layouts.
- **Context API Integration:** Uses the React Context API (`AbilityContext`) to manage and access user permissions dynamically.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v12.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- React (v17.x or later)
- Material UI (v4.x or later)

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```
## Component Structure

The `ACLPage` component is structured using Material UI's grid system, which allows for responsive layouts. It comprises two main sections, each contained within a `Grid` item:

### Common Card

- **Location:** This card is displayed on the left half of the screen on medium and larger devices (`md={6}`) and takes up the full width on smaller screens (`xs={12}`).
- **Components:**
  - **Card:** Serves as the container for the content.
  - **CardHeader:** Displays the title "Common".
  - **CardContent:** Contains text that describes the accessibility of the card. 
- **Content Details:**
  - A `Typography` element with a bottom margin (`mb={4}`) states that no special permissions are needed to view this card.
  - Another `Typography` element styled with the primary theme color indicates that the card is visible to all user roles.

### Analytics Card (Conditional Rendering)

- **Condition:** This card is only rendered if the user has the 'read' permission for the 'analytics' subject, as determined through `AbilityContext`.
- **Location:** Positioned similarly to the Common Card for consistent layout.
- **Components:**
  - **Card:** Acts as the primary container.
  - **CardHeader:** Contains the title "Analytics".
  - **CardContent:** Holds the permission-specific content.
- **Content Details:**
  - A `Typography` element explaining that only users with 'Read' permission for 'Analytics' can view this card, also styled with a bottom margin.
  - Another `Typography` styled with the error color emphasizes restricted access, indicating that this card is primarily for 'admin' roles.

## Usage

Integrate the `ACLPage` component into your application by ensuring that the `AbilityContext` is set up to manage user permissions. Here's a basic example of how to use `ACLPage` within a React application:

```jsx
import ACLPage from './components/ACLPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ACLPage />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Permissions

The `ACLPage` component enforces a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Below are the details regarding the permissions required for each part of the component:

- **Common Card:**
  - **Accessibility:** No permissions are required to view this card. It is accessible to all users.

- **Analytics Card:**
  - **Accessibility:** Viewing this card requires the 'read' permission on the 'analytics' subject. Typically, this permission is restricted to users in administrative roles.

## Integration with Material UI

The `ACLPage` component utilizes Material UI components extensively to ensure a consistent and responsive user interface. The following components are used:

- **Grid:** Provides a flexible and responsive layout framework.
- **Card, CardHeader, CardContent:** These are utilized to structure the content into distinct, stylized sections that are visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- **Typography:** Employed for displaying textual content, which allows for easy implementation of the application's theming and styling guidelines.
